NOTES FOR SELF:
set one big while statement in main that has all the while statements from the packages
that way we can have all the whiles running at once rather than individual whiles
have the big while statement have all the if statements and only run the if statements
if a variable is true that way it can still be set on/off and isnt always checking
if user doesnt want it to be enabled
