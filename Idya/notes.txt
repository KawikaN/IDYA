NOTES FOR SELF:
Create a picture path for main vl.py file that detects when a game has started using the rgb pixel function


Use copy of trig to try and change all the functions into functions with inputs so i can use them
again in other cases that I would need to take pictures. 
I tried to figure out how to get rgb pixel color using c++ but its difficult when trying to use HDC's.





make triggerbot quicker
get trig.py to import the photos
